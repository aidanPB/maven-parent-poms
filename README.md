# maven-parent-poms
Maven POM artifacts that I use (and others may use under CC-BY-SA) as parent projects.
There are currently only two of them:

1. common-parent, which from which all my Maven projects ultimately inherit; and
2. service-parent, which adds a dependency on Apache Commons Discovery.

Any other general-purpose parent POMs I come up with will be added to this repo.
