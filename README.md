# maven-parent-poms
Maven POM artifacts for use as parent projects.
There are currently only three of them:

1. common-parent, which from which all my Maven projects ultimately inherit;
2. jdbc-accessor-parent, which manages dependencies and plugins appropriate for database access; and
2. service-parent, which manages a dependency on Apache Commons Discovery.

Any other general-purpose parent POMs I come up with will be added to this repo.
